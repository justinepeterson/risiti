/**
 * Here, what we are doing is:

    creating a data schema which contains the fields we want for each Thing, their type, and whether or not they are a required field

    exporting that schema as a Mongoose model, making it available for our Express app

This model will not only allow us to enforce our data structure â€” it also makes read and write operations to the database far simpler, as you will see in the next chapters.
